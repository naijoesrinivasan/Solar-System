# Solar System Simulation in Three.js

## Description
A 3D solar system simulation built with Three.js, featuring realistic orbital mechanics, planet sizes, and lighting effects. The simulation includes all eight planets, Pluto, the Sun, and ambient lighting. The planets orbit around the Sun and rotate on their own axes at realistic speeds, with exaggerated sizes for better visibility.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naijoesrinivasan/solar-system-threejs.git
2. cd solar-system-threejs
3. npm install
4. npm start


## **Usage**
```markdown
- Open `localhost:5173` in your browser after starting the server.
- Use mouse controls to rotate around the solar system.
- Planets will rotate on their own axes and orbit the Sun.
```

## Features
- Realistic solar system simulation with orbital mechanics.
- Exaggerated planet sizes for better visualization.
- Custom lighting, including point light for the Sun and ambient light for the planets.
- Adjustable camera controls for 3D navigation.
